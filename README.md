### Amharic NLP API Building clustered API for Amharic language processing


#### Why Amharic NLP API ?

Even though a lot of research, datasets, tools and rules concerning languages such as English, Arabic, French and other languages have been conducted, there are not many studies on Amharic Language. The main purpose of the project is to build NLP API and integrate NLP functionalities to develop mobile and web app.
#### NLP Functionalities

Some of of NLP functionality are Grammar checking, Text Summarization, Paragraph and Sentence level emotion detection etc.  
Inspiration

The main reason that inspired us to participate in this project is to participate on the ever growing and advancing technologies of the NLP and the uses it brings for business and systems which deployed this feature.
Challenges

While working on this project we experienced certain difficulties, such as a lack of resources since there are not many research or projects on Amharic NLP API. Challenges that are faced during the implementation of NLP are.

    • Lack of Dataset on Amharic Language • Language complexity of Amharic Language makes hard to rule out all the rules.
    • The fact that we can express the same idea with different terms which are also dependent on the specific context 

##### The Challenges that occur during API integration are:

    High Time Consumption:
    System's Diversity: There is a big variety of software and API architectural styles.

      

Given the fact that every system has its own specific logic, every integration has its unique challenges. When it comes to integrating with multiple platforms a lot of time is required to learn each of the systems.

###### What is Amharic NLP API

An API is a set of defined rules that explain how computers or applications communicate with one another. APIs sit between an application and the web server, acting as an intermediary layer that processes data transfer between systems.
Uses Of Amharic NLP API

    1. Help Systems to Integrate Built in NLP models such as Grammer checking easily. 2. Help Systems to integrate NLP codes and procedures and best practices easily such as Amharic bigram etc. 3. Help Systems to keep up with changes and updates for good easily. 4. Being a cluster it's filled up with a lot of methods and solutions. 5. It's is easy to integrate. 6. It's hub for a lot and variety of Amharic NLP datasets.
